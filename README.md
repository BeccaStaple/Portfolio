# QA Portfolio

## Overview
The QA Portfolio is a centralised location for the end of day challenges completed.

In each question you will find:
- A Question class with an empty method inside to be completed by the 
learner
- A Test class with pre-built test cases. This runs against the Question 
class which will determine whether or not the question has been "done".


You will need to:
- Fork this repository to your own repository list on github.
- On your desktop open up a git bash terminal
- Clone your repository using ssh to your local PC.
- cd into the cloned repository
- Run `git remove -v` and it should come up with your remote repository
- Inside the each task, fill in the Question class with your answers
- Test that your solution works by running the test file
- Once the tests pass, commit your work and push it to your github 
repository using the feature-branch model
